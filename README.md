# ROBLOX-auto-payout
Sends you the Robux from your group, you can modify the wait_time, minimum_robux and maximum_robux! **THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT ON NODE.JS!**

*How to use*

Sign on replit.com,
Create a new repl,
Put the github repo (aequet/ROBLOX-auto-payout)
Go to config.json,
Put your cookies, change the wait_time if you want.
Go to index.js in the top and change the id variable to your group id,
Then run!

You can also keep the bot alive by running the bot then a white case above the console should appear,
Copy the link id in this case, 
Then go to https://uptimerobot.com,
Then create a new computer, and set it to HTTPS then put the link id.
Then you should be good to go!

**REMEMBER!**
This is my first project in node, if you see any errors, its normal.
